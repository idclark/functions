Analysis of Panel Data 

Panel_func is a script containing several functions for analysis of panel data with R. It is primarily intended as a practice in statistics and computing and not as a replacement for R's built in functions or packages. The PLM library is an optimized source for Panel analysis.

Included as of 11/5/11

* OLS regression. - note that this and the rest of the file relies heavily on solve() to invert matrices and will struggle with large matrices. 

*LSDV - least squares dummy variable regression with 0,1 indicators for time and unit effects. 

* Fixed Effects with within and between group estimators. Fixed effects has been broken into two functions for fixed and within group estimation separately. 

* Random Effects with Feasible Least Generalized Least Squares FGLS

* Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE)
